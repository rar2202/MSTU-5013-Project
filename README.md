# MSTU-5013-Project

By: Becca Rosenberg and Mary Babin

Description: A "teacher-maintained" website that is designed for students and parents to better understand concepts that their children are learning in school. The website has three main objectives:

To provide information, practice problems, and helpful links for students and parents for each math unit.

To help children become comfortable with the types of questions they will be expected to interact with during state-wide computer-based standardized testing. Practice questions will be formatted using a game-like structure so children are exposed to academic content while also having fun.

To provide parents with an FAQ resource where they can look up frequently asked questions, as well as ask their own.
